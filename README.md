## Overview

Tarmac is a Python package that helps you understand and document differences between ML model versions, with future support for automated EU AI Act compliance reports. It provides:

- **Model Comparison**: Compare predictions between any two ML models, like git diff
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Use built-in datasets or your own data for comparison
- **Automatic Task Detection**: Supports both classification and regression tasks
- **Explainable Differences**: Generate human-readable rules that explain where and how models differ
- **Flexible Output**: Get results in JSON or text format, with optional user-friendly explanations
- **Future AI Act Support**: Automated report generation for EU AI Act compliance (coming soon)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrida/tarmac
cd tarmac
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

Check out our [quickstart notebook](notebooks/quickstart.ipynb) for an interactive example using a toy dataset to understand how Tarmac works.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example comparing two classification models using the iris dataset:

```bash
# Compare two models using the built-in iris dataset
tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --sampling builtin --data iris

# Compare models with custom datasets
tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl \
    --sampling union \
    --Xa features_a.csv --ya targets_a.csv \
    --Xb features_b.csv --yb targets_b.csv

# Save the analysis to a file with user-friendly explanations
tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl -o analysis.txt --uf
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

The main command in Tarmac is `diff`, which analyzes differences between two models:

```bash
tarmac diff [MODEL_A] [MODEL_B] [OPTIONS]
```

### Sampling Strategies

### Sampling Strategies

Currently, Tarmac implements the sampling strategy from [Dynamic Interpretability for Model Comparison via Decision Rules (Rida et al., 2023)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-74630-7_23), which uses the union of both models' training datasets:

1. **Built-in Datasets**:
   ```bash
   tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --sampling builtin --data iris
   tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --sampling builtin --data diabetes
   ```

2. **Custom Datasets**:
   ```bash
   tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --sampling union \
       --Xa features_a.csv --ya targets_a.csv \
       --Xb features_b.csv --yb targets_b.csv
   ```

### Task Types

Tarmac automatically detects whether you're comparing classification or regression models, but you can also specify explicitly:

```bash
tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --task classification
tarmac diff model_a.pkl model_b.pkl --task regression --epsilon 0.1
```

### Output Options

1. **Console Output**: By default, Tarmac prints results to the console
2. **JSON Output**: `--output results.json` for structured data
3. **Text Output**: `--output results.txt` for plain text
4. **User-Friendly**: Add `--uf` for detailed explanations

## Advanced Configuration

- `--min_samples_leaf`: Control the granularity of difference detection (default: 0.01)
- `--epsilon`: Set the threshold for considering regression predictions different (default: 0.05)
